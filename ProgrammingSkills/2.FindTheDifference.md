# Find the Difference

## Problem Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
```

**Explanation:** 'e' is the letter that was added.

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach

The solution uses a brute force approach to find the difference:

1. First, validate the constraints to ensure inputs are within bounds
2. Handle the edge case where `s` is empty - return the first character of `t`
3. For each character in `s`, find and remove the corresponding character in `t`
4. After removing all matching characters, the remaining character in `t` is the added letter

### Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(n²) where n is the length of string `s` (nested loops with string erase operation)
- **Space:** O(1) if we don't count the input modification, O(n) considering string operations

## Alternative Solutions

### More Efficient Approach using XOR

```cpp
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    char result = 0;
    
    // XOR all characters in both strings
    for(char c : s) result ^= c;
    for(char c : t) result ^= c;
    
    return result; // The extra character will remain
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Using Character Sum

```cpp
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    int sum_s = 0, sum_t = 0;
    
    for(char c : s) sum_s += c;
    for(char c : t) sum_t += c;
    
    return (char)(sum_t - sum_s);
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Notes

- The current implementation modifies the input string `t`, which might not be ideal in some scenarios
- The brute force approach has O(n²) time complexity due to nested loops and string erase operations
- More efficient solutions exist using XOR operations or sum differences with O(n) time complexity
- The solution includes constraint validation as per the problem requirements
- Edge case handling for empty string `s` is implemented
